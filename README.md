# distroless-zipapp
Example of Python application containerised using [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless/blob/main/experimental/python3/README.md) and [zipapp](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html). In combination, these tools can produce very compact Python-based images with nearly all of the benefits of single binary executables.
